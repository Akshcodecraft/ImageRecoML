 About This Project

This repository contains the work I completed as part of the **Image Recognition 5 Days Bootcamp**.
I participated in this bootcamp as a **learner** (not as an organizer) and implemented the same models and techniques demonstrated during the sessions.

The bootcamp focused on practical, hands-on learning in deep learning and computer vision, using **Google Colab** and **TensorFlow/Keras**.

Topics covered during the 5 days:

Day 1:Dataset download, MNIST & CIFAR-10 exploration, preprocessing, and visualization
Day 2:Building and training a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
Day 3:Data augmentation, batch normalization, and improving model performance
Day 4:Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 on Cats vs. Dogs dataset (Kaggle)
Day 5: Model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC/AUC) and deployment tips

My Role

* I attended all five days of the bootcamp as a participant.
* I implemented the models, techniques, and workflows exactly as taught during the sessions.
* The code here represents my practical learning outcome from the bootcamp.

 How to Run

1. Open in Colab:
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Akshcodecraft/ImageRecoML/blob/main/Image_Recognition_5Days_Bootcamp.ipynb)

2. Run Locally:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshcodecraft/ImageRecoML.git
   cd ImageRecoML
   # Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
   

 Key Features Learned

* Download and preprocess datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Cats vs. Dogs)
* Build and train CNNs from scratch with Keras
* Apply data augmentation and batch normalization
* Use transfer learning (MobileNetV2)
* Evaluate models with confusion matrix, classification report, ROC/AUC
* Save, load, and deploy models

 Results Achieved

MNIST: >99% accuracy
CIFAR-10:\~69% accuracy
Cats vs. Dogs (Transfer Learning): ~88% accuracy

 Skills Gained

* Deep Learning & CNNs
* Data preprocessing & augmentation
* Model evaluation & visualization
* Transfer learning with fine-tuning
* TensorFlow & Keras
* Google Colab & Kaggle workflows
* Git version control
