About This Project

This repository contains my implementation from the Image Recognition Bootcamp, where I participated as a learner.
I followed the sessions step-by-step and built the models as taught during the program, using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab.

The project covers:

* Dataset loading and preprocessing
* CNN model creation from scratch
* Model training and evaluation
* Transfer learning for improved accuracy
* Visualization of predictions and metrics

My Role

* Fully implemented the notebook code as part of the bootcamp learning process
* Applied the same architectures and preprocessing steps demonstrated during the sessions
* Achieved reproducible results using Google Colab

 How to Run

1. Open in Google Colab:
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Akshcodecraft/ImageRecoML/blob/main/Image_Recognition_BootCamp.ipynb)

2. Run Locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshcodecraft/ImageRecoML.git
   cd ImageRecoML
   # Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
   ```

Key Features Implemented

* Downloading and preprocessing datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, Cats vs. Dogs)
* Building and training Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch
* Data augmentation and normalization for better generalization
* Transfer learning using MobileNetV2
* Model evaluation with accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, and classification report
* Saving and loading trained models

 Results

* Achieved high accuracy on MNIST (>99%)
* Achieved ~69% accuracy on CIFAR-10
* Achieved ~88% accuracy on Cats vs. Dogs (transfer learning)

 Skills Gained

* Deep Learning using TensorFlow & Keras
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) design
* Transfer Learning
* Model evaluation & visualization techniques
* Data preprocessing & augmentation
* Working with Google Colab and Kaggle datasets
* Version control with Git & GitHub

Do you want me to **also include sample prediction images and accuracy graphs from your notebook** in this README so it looks more visually engaging on GitHub? That would make it stand out.
